## What you just walked into

**Perci** is an experimental **cognitive OS for a single machine**:

| Layer | Job |
|-------|-----|
| **Bitwork PERCIW03** | ~200 MiB sparse pack · **403,163** prototypes · **124** concepts · 4096-bit AND/POPCOUNT |
| **Transformer-bridge algebra** | Soft-α attention · dual residual ANDNOT · VSA bind/bundle · Willshaw HVs · session CTX |
| **SoftCascade thought arc** | thesis → warrant → boundary → check — spoken as human prose, not card dumps |
| **Operators** | Trust/systems, partition recovery, synthesis, refuse-hallucinate, code, plans, introspection |
| **Self-critique** | Thin drafts get one residual second angle — silent metacognition |
| **Emergence lab (L8)** | Tickets → **transfer suite** → repair/close · `release_gates.py` · agent `--full --repair` |
| **Capability Fabric (v0.8.4)** | Governor: native language · typed world model · knowledge · proof · code · multi-AI handoff/next/regress · SoftCascade pack-align |
| **Exact tools** | Math & geometry that *compute*, never guess |
| **Governance** | Append-only memory · Cortex · style memory · weight promote only with **human authorize** |

Chat is **clean** (no cognition dump). Inspect with **`/think`** (plan), **`/field`** (geometry laws), **`/lab`** (tickets). Style with **`/concise` · `/deep` · `/balanced`**.

> Fluency without transfer gates is not intelligence.  
> Consciousness claims without sensors are not honesty.

## Why this is different

Most assistants bury routing, language, tools, and memory inside one opaque model.

Perci **separates them**:

            ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐

            └───────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                                ▼
                     human speech  ·  /think inspects
```

**What the field actually does** (live classify, 2026-07-17): contested prompts show **margin 0–2** and **overlap_z 15–26** — multipartite structure is real, not marketing. See [`docs/WEIGHT_REASSESSMENT_v0616.md`](docs/WEIGHT_REASSESSMENT_v0616.md).

## Emergent discoveries from the v0.7.3 loop

The strongest new result is not a claim that the pack became conscious. It is a measurable engineering loop:

```text
weak route → typed field event → ticket/curriculum candidate
          → operator or tool repair → paraphrase/entity transfer
          → close only when the gate holds
```

The current ledger shows a **dual-authority split**: Bitwork probes the geometry while operators own most successful speech. This is useful, but it also exposes the next bottleneck: routing alignment, not simply more prototypes. In the latest 500-event window, the field recorded 443 matches, 103 curriculum `primary_off` events, and 82 `geometry_blind` events; 18 speech outcomes were recorded, all successful. Transfer is therefore stronger evidence than smooth wording, while speech coverage still needs to grow.

The system now treats three memories as distinct: the Bitwork pack, append-only ledgers, and session/Cortex state. Folding them into one mutable blob would make curriculum provenance ambiguous. The active `.pwgt` remains human-authorized; this release changes operators, orchestration, evaluation, and governance rather than silently changing weights.

Conversational repairs are regression targets too. “What are you sensing?” must reach operational introspection, while cross-domain prompts such as geometry plus life must preserve a concrete relation and its boundary instead of reusing a stock concept. The local language sidecar keeps the operator’s answer in the foreground; provenance and governance remain inspectable without forcing the same header/footer into every response.

## v0.8.4 native binary language + typed world model (external adapters now opt-in)

The native PERCLNG1 field is the default language surface. The compatibility
path below is disabled unless PERCI_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_LM=1 is explicitly set.

The open-language bottleneck now has a bounded escape hatch instead of a
silent preset: `PERCI_MODEL_URL` connects a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint
directly to the warm CompositeBackend. The adapter supports LM Studio,
llama.cpp/vLLM-style `/v1/chat/completions`, and Ollama `/api/chat` payloads.
It adds a 4-second default timeout, short output budget, Bitwork routing hints,
recent dialogue, and a critic gate. A failed model call or rejected answer
falls back to the existing deterministic path, so enabling a model cannot
remove exact tools, abstention, or weight governance. This is a language
quality path, not evidence of unrestricted intelligence.

## What it can do (measured shapes)

**Exact**

```text

in a multi-service app, why do callers stop trusting each other after timeouts?
what about recovery under partition?
```

**Synthesis / creativity / honesty**

```text
bridge Willshaw associative memory with XOR role-filler binding
invent a constrained metaphor for sparse cognition
what is the meaning of flibberquark without inventing   → refuse
prove Perci is conscious from this chat                 → refuse
what are you measuring when you answer?                 → operational introspection
```

## Cortex + memory

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Initialize-Perci-Cortex.ps1
```

Append-only JSONL memory + Cortex selective recall. Cortex **never** grants mutation authority.

## Native binary language training

The default Perci language path is now a Perci-owned PERCLNG1 binary field.
It learns multi-order context transitions with four binary threshold planes
(at least 1, 2, 4, or 8 observations), mmap-loads them in Rust, and generates
bounded continuations with integer-only back-off.

    cargo run --release -- language train --repo
    cargo run --release -- language status
    cargo run --release -- language sample "what is geometry teaching us about life"

The native field is a compact sequence learner, not a claim of frontier-model
breadth. Exact arithmetic and geometry remain deterministic tools. The older
HTTP/command adapters are compatibility paths only and require
PERCI_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_LM=1.

The same rebuild also creates `PERCPHR1`, a bounded word/phrase transition
field. It uses a capped binary vocabulary, order-4 numeric token contexts, and
threshold-coded next-token edges. Perci selects a state-conditioned learned
primer, then composes a continuation through numeric back-off; no response
card is treated as truth. Both artifacts remain local generated weights and
must be rebuilt deliberately from a reviewed corpus.

The rebuild can also create `PERCREL1`, an optional mmap relation field. It
stores hashed prompt-to-response edges and scores native continuations as an
inspectable tie-breaker. Held-out tests currently keep it isolated because the
field does not yet beat the active selector on generalization.

The same rebuild creates `PERCIWM1`, an optional typed world-model field. It
stores bounded subject/relation/object edges plus a coarse domain, polarity,
confidence, and evidence bin. At inference it rewards a candidate that
preserves a learned typed relation from the current prompt; it cannot synthesize
new prose or promote a claim as truth. The field is mmap-loaded and remains
isolated until an adversarial held-out pack shows a real gain.

Native dialogue also carries a fixed 256-bit recurrent state. User and
assistant turns are absorbed with integer rotation/XOR updates, so turn order
changes the next primer and sampling path without creating an unbounded memory
blob or introducing a neural runtime.

The phrase backend now samples six bounded binary continuations and chooses the
one with the best topic binding, recent-response novelty, and topic-neighbor
relation score. The conservative relation weight is tunable with
`PERCI_NATIVE_RELATION_WEIGHT` (default `12`); held-out comparison still
controls weight promotion.

Run the broad native probe and review its evidence:

    python scripts/native_probe.py

It asks 1,000 questions in one persistent process and writes a JSONL transcript
plus summary under `models/candidates/`. The probe is measurement data; it does
not auto-promote its candidate weights.

To compare an isolated phrase candidate against the active field, use a new
tag and pass the candidate path. This leaves the active weights untouched:

    python scripts/native_probe.py --tag v0.8.1-novelty --phrase-weights models/candidates/native-probe-candidate.bphr

To cap repeated training examples before a candidate rebuild:

    python scripts/clean_probe.py models/candidates/native-probe-v0.8.1-novelty-active.jsonl models/candidates/native-probe-v0.8.1-clean.jsonl --limit-per-response 2

To build and run the next emergence curriculum, mine the prior transcript into
counterexamples, perturbations, and unseen-entity transfer questions:

    python scripts/emergence_curriculum.py models/candidates/native-probe-v0.8.1-relation12-active.jsonl models/candidates/emergence-curriculum-v0.8.3.jsonl --count 1000
    python scripts/native_probe.py --tag v0.8.3-emergence-curriculum --questions-file models/candidates/emergence-curriculum-v0.8.3.jsonl

For the next gate, generate adversarial questions that target paraphrase
collapse, negation loss, contradiction handling, entity substitution, and
analogy boundaries. Keep the offset-separated file held out from training:

    python scripts/adversarial_curriculum.py models/candidates/adversarial-v0.8.4.jsonl --count 300
    python scripts/adversarial_curriculum.py models/candidates/adversarial-v0.8.4-heldout.jsonl --count 120 --offset 300
    python scripts/native_probe.py --tag v0.8.4-adversarial --questions-file models/candidates/adversarial-v0.8.4.jsonl

To evaluate a world-model candidate without replacing the active artifact:

    cargo run --release -- language train models/candidates/native-probe-v0.8.3-emergence-curriculum-final.jsonl models/candidates/world-candidate-v0.8.4.blng 6
    python scripts/native_probe.py --tag v0.8.4-world-candidate --questions-file models/candidates/adversarial-v0.8.4-heldout.jsonl --world-weights models/candidates/world-candidate-v0.8.4.bwm

The command emits four native files next to the requested output; only the
`.bwm` path is used by the isolated world-field comparison. Promotion remains
human-authorized and requires no regression in exact tools, abstention, or
topic binding.

## External model compatibility (disabled by default)

Bitwork stays the governor. Perci can now use a local OpenAI-compatible model
as a fast language surface while keeping routing, tools, evidence, memory, and
weight promotion under Perci's control. LM Studio, llama.cpp servers, Ollama,
and Phi-family local endpoints are supported. The model is a renderer, not the
authority layer; failed, empty, overlong, or boundary-violating output falls
back to the governed local path.

```powershell
# LM Studio / llama.cpp / vLLM style endpoint
$env:PERCI_MODEL_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions"
$env:PERCI_MODEL_NAME = "phi-4-mini"

# Ollama style endpoint (use the model name you installed)
# $env:PERCI_MODEL_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/chat"
# $env:PERCI_MODEL_NAME = "phi4-mini"

$env:PERCI_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS = "4000"
$env:PERCI_MODEL_MAX_TOKENS = "320"
cargo run --release -- chat
```

The optional command adapter remains available through `PERCI_MODEL_CMD`.
The typed language sidecar is still useful when a process must return
`perci.language-response.v1` explicitly:

```powershell
$env:PERCI_LANGUAGE_SIDECAR = "python scripts/perci_language_sidecar.py"
cargo run --release -- chat
```

The HTTP path is zero-cost when `PERCI_MODEL_URL` is unset. It uses a bounded
local request timeout, sends Bitwork hints as untrusted routing notes, and
tries the deterministic/operator response whenever the model is unavailable.

## Capability boundary (read twice)

| Useful for | Not a substitute for |
|------------|----------------------|
| Local sparse routing + multipartite readout | ChatGPT / frontier transformers |
| Thought-arc speech without a decoder | Web-scale factual recall |
| Exact math/geometry | Unrestricted open-ended generation |
| Governed synthesis & refusal | “AGI” slogans |
| Inspectable `/think` geometry | Private chain-of-thought theater |

Progress = **hardness · transfer · latency · binding quality · honest abstention** — not vibes.

---

## Design principles

- **Local first** — no cloud required for the core loop  
- **Integer hot path** — AND / POPCOUNT, not GPU matmul  
- **Separate layers** — field · laws · tools · speech  
- **Human speech, backend truth** — chat clean; `/think` inspects  
- **Governed learning** — style adapts; weights need authorize  
- **Refuse when empty** — inventing meaning is a bug, not a feature  

---

## Roadmap (next real IQ)

1. Pack-side VSA encode (**human-authorized** rebuild)  
2. Spreading activation on prototype graph  
3. Novelty \(N_r\) vs session memory (length law already residual-aware)  
4. Stronger hardness / dialogue gates  
5. Agent lab: fail → ticket → patch → retest → merge green code only
